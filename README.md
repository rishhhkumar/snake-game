# snake-game
A simple Snake game implemented in Java using Swing

### Overview
The game consists of a snake that moves around the board, eating food to grow longer. The goal is to keep the snake alive as long as possible without hitting the walls or itself.

### Features
- Snake Movement: Control the snake using AWSD keys.
- Food: Randomly placed food that the snake eats to grow longer.
- Wrap Around: The snake wraps around the edges of the board.
- Simple UI: Basic graphical interface using Java Swing.

### How to Play
1. Start the Game: Run the compiled SnakeGame class.
2. Control the Snake: Use the following keys to move the snake:
- W: Move up
- S: Move down
- A: Move left
- D: Move right
3. Objective: Eat the yellow food squares to grow longer.
4. Game Over: The game ends if the snake hits itself or the walls.

### Code Structure
- App.java: The entry point of the application. It initializes the game window and starts the game.
- SnakeGame.java: Contains the main game logic, including the game loop, snake movement, food placement, and rendering.
- Inner Class Tile: This represents a tile on the game board for the snake's body and food positions.
